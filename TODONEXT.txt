TO DO LIST for this sketch.

The sketch already does what it is supposed to.

Eventually, it could be completed/modified to :

1. Propose the user to skip the ESC calibration and directy go to testing procedure

2. Propose the user to automatically apply a ramp from 0% to 100% throttle after the calibration procedure. Something like, start from 0, increment by 0.1% every 0.2ms up to 100% with serial output of the value sent. This would allow to check for dead zone, or useful to mesure thrust with a dynamometer...

3. Add many extras like user-input of the range, the arduino PWM pin....
